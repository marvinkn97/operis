# OPERIS - Project Management System

---
The **Operis** project aims to simplify project management for businesses and individuals
through a web application for workload management. This solution will allow for breaking
down projects into tasks, distributing them among team members, and tracking their
progress, all while offering a comprehensive overview of the overall advancement.

Operis's business model is based on the Freemium model, offering free basic features such
as the creation, modification, and deletion of projects, as well as the management of
members and tasks, among others. Advanced features, such as the CSV export of project
tasks, will be available with a paid subscription.

In addition to its functionalities, Operis offers user account management and a mechanism to
switch from free to premium mode, and vice versa. This approach will allow users to benefit
from the features necessary for their needs while having the possibility to upgrade to more
advanced features according to their requirements and budget.
